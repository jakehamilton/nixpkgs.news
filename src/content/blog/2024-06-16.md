[@Infinisil](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/Infinisil) has updated the community on the [Nix Constitutional Assembly, pertaining to the target date, public repository, office hours, and interviews](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/constitutional-assembly-announcement-target-date-public-repo-office-hours-interviews/46827).
The assembly members have been working out the details over the last few weeks and have set a goal for
completion of this work by 2024-09-01. In addition to this target date, a place for housing related documents
has been created [on GitHub](https://github.com/nixos/nix-constitutional-assembly). This repository is intended
to serve as the central point of information for the assembly. Office hours and interviews are also now
running in an effort to gather feedback and answer questions. Open office hours and information on requesting
a private interview can be found in the linked announcement.

[@hellwolf](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/hellwolf) released [mk-cache-key.nix](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/mk-cache-key-nix-make-build-cache-key-for-half-board-nix-projects/46771),
a tool for helping to improve caching in CI for projects that have not fully adopted Nix yet. For more
detailed usage information and examples, see the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/hellwolf/mk-cache-key.nix/tree/master).
