After our brief hiatus last week to allow for community events to settle down we are now back with the
weekly Nix recap!

[@fricklerhandwerk](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/fricklerhandwerk) posted a [notice for an important Nix security fix](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/security-fix-nix-derivation-sandbox-escape/47778).
This fix resolves [`CVE-2024-38531`](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38531) which is a sandbox escape vulnerability in Nix. All Nix users should update
immediately to avoid security risks. All Nix versions from `2.18` through `2.23` have received a patch
for this vulnerability.

[@shivaraj-bh](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/shivaraj-bh) announced [`github-nix-ci`](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/github-nix-ci-for-self-hosting-github-runners-on-macos-linux/47642),
a project which provides NixOS and nix-darwin modules for self-hosting GitHub runners. This is an
excellent addition to every hobbyist's toolkit to allow for taking advantage of GitHub Actions while
avoiding free-tier monthly limits. To get started with the project, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/juspay/github-nix-ci).

[@7c6f434c](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/7c6f434c) let the community know that [RFC 0146, `Meta.Categories`, is
in its Final Comment Period](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/rfc-0146-fcp-meta-categories/47818).
This feature has been in the works for over a year and is sorely needed to help expand Nixpkgs' metadata
and discoverability. Once merged, packages in Nixpkgs will now be able to specify useful categories in their
`meta` properties similar to desktop items. To read the full proposal, see the issue
[on GitHub](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/146).

[@drmikecrowe](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/drmikecrowe) has created [Xonsh xontribs](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/xonsh-xontribs-announcing-xontrib-nur-repository/47744),
a collection of packages for the Python-powered Xonsh shell. For Xonsh users or people interested in giving
it a try, you can find the package set [on GitHub](https://github.com/drmikecrowe/nur-packages).

[@JulienMalka](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/JulienMalka) announced general availability for
[Proxmox-NixOS](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/announcing-proxmox-nixos/47579)! This project brings the
[Proxmox Hypervisor](https://www.proxmox.com/) to NixOS, enabling a new host of virtualization options for
the platform and ecosystem. If you are currently operating virtual machines or run a home lab, it is worth
giving this project a try. The project is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/SaumonNet/proxmox-nixos).

[@Mic92](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/Mic92) posted an article on [Declarative Backups and Restore](https://docs.clan.lol/blog/2024/06/24/backups/) using the [Clan](https://clan.lol) project.
A fully formed backup solution this easy to use is certainly worth a look!
