### NixOS 24.05 Release

It's release week for NixOS! The brand new 24.05 release, codename "Uakari", is out officially out. The
release managers deserve thanks for their work in making this release happen. Thank you to
[Weijia Wang](https://github.com/wegank), [JÃ¶rg Thalheim](https://github.com/Mic92), and everyone else
who contributed to this event no matter how small. A full release announcement can be found
[on the NixOS blog](https://nixos.org/blog/announcements/2024/nixos-2405/) and comprehensive release notes
are [available in the manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/release-notes#sec-release-24.05). While
this article will not cover all of the highlights and breaking changes found in the release, the following
are a set of interesting changes picked out by the author of [nixpkgs.news](https://nixpkgs.news).

#### 24.05 highlights

- The default Linux kernel is now version 6.6.

- A new ELF loader is now available to improve the non-nix packaged software user experience.
- `NIX_PATH` and the Flake Registry will now automatically have the system's `nixpkgs` input pinned when creating systems with `nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem`.
- [Plasma 6](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/) is now available.
- [Lomiri](https://lomiri.com/) (formerly Unity8) is now available.
- [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org/) is now updated to version 1.28.
- Perl can now be avoided entirely by importing the module `${modulesPath}/profiles/perlless.nix`.
- A new service for [ALVR](https://github.com/alvr-org/alvr) is available with the option `programs.alvr`.

#### 24.05 breaking changes

- `akkoma` now requires `setttings."Pleroma.Upload".base_url` to be set.
- `appimageTools.wrapAppImage` now exports binaries as `pname` instead of `${pname}-${version}`.
- `boot.supportedFilesystems` and `boot.initrd.supportedFilesystems` are now attribute sets instead of lists.
- `cryptsetup` has been upgraded, users should verify that their encryption setup is still working correctly.
- `inetutils` has had its priority lowered to avoid shadowing util-linux.
- `lua`'s `LUA_PATH` and `LUA_CPATH` are no longer overriden. Instead, `LUA_ROOT` is modified.
- `nixVersions.unstable` has been replaced by `nixVersions.latest` and `nixVersions.git`.
- `pipewire` and `wireplumber` can not be configured by setting files with `environment.etc`. Instead, their `extraConfig` and `configPackages` options should be used.

### Community Recap

Aside from the release of NixOS 24.05, we saw [@tad](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/tad) announce a
[call for gradle2nix v2 testers](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/gradle2nix-v2-call-for-testers/46199).
The project has been completely rewritten to be faster and more reliable. Any community members wanting
to try out the new version can access it via the [`v2` branch on GitHub](https://github.com/tadfisher/gradle2nix/tree/v2)
and can find a summary of changes [documented here](https://github.com/tadfisher/gradle2nix/pull/62).

Last week also began the migration of [Snowfall Lib users to v3](https://snowfall.org/guides/lib/migration/v3/).
This release includes improved integration with Home-Manager, the ability to define homes for all matching
system types instead of a single host, more flexible overlays, first-class namespace support, as well as
NixOS and Home-Manager modules which are automatically added to configurations in order to provide additional
context such as the current user or to pass through Home-Manager configuration.
