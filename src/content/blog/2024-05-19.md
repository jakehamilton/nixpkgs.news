description: Weekly recap of the announcements and activity in the Nix community and on the NixPkgs package repository.
---

As we pass the halfway mark of the month, the [Zero Hydra Failures initiative](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/309482)
for the new NixOS 24.05 release has picked up steam. This important step in the release cycle is focused on resolving
package build failures that would otherwise prevent a release or require certain packages to be marked as broken.
Interested contributors can look at the [Nix Review Tools Reports](https://malob.github.io/nix-review-tools-reports/) site
to discover failing builds that need fixing. Moving forward, release channels will be created on May 22nd to finalize
them before the official release at the end of the month.

[@ron](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/ron) released an update on the [Constitutional Assembly Appointment](https://malob.github.io/nix-review-tools-reports/). After nominations for the assembly closed last week, 7 members were selected to construct
the new governance model for Nix. The chosen assembly members represent highly-skilled and involved members of the
community and will require the next few weeks to work out the necessary changes to the Nix ecosystem. For more information
about the specific assembly members, including their applications for the process, see the linked announcement.

[@fricklerhandwerk](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/fricklerhandwerk) posted a [call for volunteers to curate official
Nix projects](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-volunteers-curating-official-projects/45382). The Nix ecosystem
has few official projects, limiting its scope to NixPkgs, NixOS, and Nix mainly. However, third-party Nix projects have
become vital underpinnings of the technology's use. With this in mind, the intent of the linked post is to begin curating
a set of these projects which can be officially supported. This would be an important step to improving the maintenance
story for many projects as well as increasing interoperability and consistency between Nix tools.

[@dnr](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/dnr) announced [Styx, an alternate binary substitution mechanism](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/styx-alternate-binary-substitution-mechanism/45579).
Styx breaks up files into chunks and allows substitutors to only download the new chunks that they don't already have.
The project is also capable of using differential compression on sequences of chunks, producing a read-only filesystem where
files share chunks, fetching and caching chunks on-demand, and reducing the overall disk requirements for binary caches
that would otherwise be storing Nix Archives (NARs).

nixpkgs.news is now also accepting sponsorship applications! If you or your business benefit from the publication and would
like to support it financially, you can reach out [via email](mailto:jake.hamilton@hey.com). All sponsorships of nixpkgs.news
articles will take the form of non-intrusive and relevant text-based advertisement.

Readers interested in supporting the effort can also consider [subscribing on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jakehamilton).
Doing so provides multiple benefits such as early access to nixpkgs.news articles, early access to upcoming projects, one-on-one
Nix support, bi-weekly updates for the in-progress book Nix For Newcomers, and more!
