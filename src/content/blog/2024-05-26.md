---

This week saw the last major step in the NixOS 24.05 release process, including creation of the `release-24.05`
branch, release channels, and redirection of new [Zero Hydra Failures](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/309482)
fixes to `master` with the ability to backport fixes to the 24.05 release. The official release will occur on
May 31st, 2024. If you would like to start using the new version early, users can update their systems to point
to the new `nixos-24.05` branch.

The [Nix Constitutional Assembly](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-board-giving-power-to-the-community/44552?u=jakehamilton) continues to make progress. [@7c6f434c](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/7c6f434c) announced
that an [Assembly Q&A stream](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/assembly-q-a-stream/45707) will be held on
Monday, May 20th, 2024 at 19:00 UTC. Interested parties may participate in the question and answer session
via [Zulip](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/438035-Assembly-Q.26A/topic/stream.20events) and
the [Google Meet call](https://meet.google.com/zkm-jcwr-ebi). Before participating, please note the rules
for the assembly and this event in the announcement post.

[@codesupply](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/codesupply) has released [deps_nix](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/deps-nix-mix2nix-alternative-as-a-mix-task/45740),
a Nix builder for Elixir. The project aims to be a drop-in replacement for [mix2nix](https://github.com/ydlr/mix2nix)
while adding support for Git dependencies, environment/package selection, and improved output formatting.
deps_nix is available today on [GitHub](https://github.com/code-supply/deps_nix).

[@teto](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/teto) let Neovim users know that [Neovim's flake.nix moved to nix-community](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/neovims-flake-nix-moved-to-nix-community/45887).
For users who were previously pulling Neovim Nightly from the upstream repository's flake, the input will need to
be modified to point to [`github:nix-community/neovim-nightly-overlay`](https://github.com/nix-community/neovim-nightly-overlay).

[@DavHau](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/DavHau) introduced a [NixOS to JSON Schema Converter](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/introducing-the-nixos-to-json-schema-converter/45948),
a tool which allows you to extract JSON Schema definitions from NixOS modules. Official documentation for the
project can be found at [docs.clan.lol](https://docs.clan.lol/blog/2024/05/25/jsonschema-converter/).
